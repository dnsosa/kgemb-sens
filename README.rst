kgemb-sens
=============
A package for setting up and running experiments on the sensitivity of knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods to
sparsity and inconsistency.

This package was written as source code to accompany the work `Elucidating the Semantics-Topology Trade-off for Knowledge Inference-Based Pharmacological Discovery` (In Review). This package:

- Loads various KG embedding datasets
- Automates experiments on inducing sparsity in a KG with various tunable parameters
- Automates experiments on inducing contradictory information in a KG with various tunable parameters
- Runs PyKEEN-based embedding pipeline
- Provides code for plotting small example networks
- Tests functionality on toy network
